# PeriksaJamak
A tool to check if an Indonesian plural form in Gettext .po file was instead translated into English form

Technically it checks if the target sentences use English form of plurals, so if your target language use different plural form than English ones, you can use this tool to help you, and you can ignore the error message since it actually sounds like the git's description.

The source code was tested on Java 8 and only works for Gettext PO files.
